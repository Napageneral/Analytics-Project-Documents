# Importance of Clean Code
- A messy code base causes a decrease in productivity over time.
- Code should be elegant, have minimal dependencies, and contain no duplication.
- Code must not only be written cleanly, but the cleanliness must be maintained over time.

Most major software projects have their own style guide: a set of conventions (sometimes arbitrary) about how to write code for that project. It is much easier to understand a large codebase when all the code in it is in a consistent style.

“Style” covers a lot of ground, from “use camelCase for variable names” to “never use global variables” to “never use exceptions.”

You will find the shorter shallower version of the style guide as well as an in-depth guide below that.
