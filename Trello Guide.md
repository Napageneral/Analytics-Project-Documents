# Trello Guide

## Lists

### Backlog
Holds all scheduled tasks. A space to hold and develop ideas into actionable items until they're ready to be started.

### Next
Contains tasks ready to be completed listed in order with most important tasks at the top. Tasks may be assigned to individual developers at this stage.

### In Progress
Once a developer starts a task it will be moved to this list to indicate work is progressing

### Ready For Review
Once the task is complete and ready to be reviewed it will be moved here until it has been reviewed by another developer. If changes are needed, move the card back to **Next** with comments. Otherwise, move the task to **Completed**.

### Completed
Reviewed and ready for production/finalization.


## Additional Comments

### Urgent Tasks
When you need to mark a task as urgent, assign it a ***green*** label, so developers know the task is critical and needs to be addressed ASAP.
Use this label sparingly.

### Starting Work
To Start work on a card, a developer will move it from the **Next** column to the **In Progress** column and assign the card to themselves.

### Requesting Feedback
- Some decisions can't be made without feedback/input. 
- When that happens, the developer will block the task for feedback by assigning a ***red*** label and @mention the person whose feedback is requested.
- Once a task has been blocked, it can remain in the **In Progress** list, but must retain the ***red*** label until the task in unblocked.
- Once the task is unblocked, simply remove the ***red*** label.

### More Work Needs to Be Done
If a **Completed** card is found to have a bug, add a comment describing the bug and any necessary changes then move the card back to the **Next** list, possibly with a ***green*** label if the bug-fix is urgent.
